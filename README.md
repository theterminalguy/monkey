# monkey

monkey is an experimental programming language with the following features:

- C-like syntax
- variable bindings
- integers and booleans
- arithmetic expressions
- built-in functions
- first-class and higher-order functions
- closures 
- a string data structure
- an array data structure
- a hash data structure

# Example

1. Binding values to names in monkey

```
let age = 10;
let name = "monkey";
let result = age * 2;
```

2. Biding an array of integers

```
let fiboSequence = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```

3. A hash 

```
let album = { name: "Thriller", artist: "Micheal Jackson", release: "November 30, 1982" }
```
